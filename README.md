### 🔒 Private GitHub Projects

Some of my projects (including production-grade client work and experimental systems) are kept **private on GitHub**.  
This is mainly to **respect client confidentiality**, protect **proprietary business logic and data**, and keep **in‑progress or research projects** away from public exposure until they are fully ready.  
If you're interested in a specific type of project, I’m happy to **walk you through the implementation details during an interview or via a private demo**.
